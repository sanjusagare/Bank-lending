# Bank-lending
In this project you will have to put yourself in the shoes of a loan issuer and manage credit risk by using the past data and deciding whom to give the loan to in the future. The text files contain complete loan data for all loans issued by XYZ Corp. through 2007-2015. The data contains the indicator of default, payment information, credit history, etc.
